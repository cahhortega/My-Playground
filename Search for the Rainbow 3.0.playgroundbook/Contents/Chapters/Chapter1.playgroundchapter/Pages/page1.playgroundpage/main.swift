//: # Search for the Rainbow
//: Once upon a time, there was a boy named Peter.
//: Peter was a very sad child because he saw things differently from other children.
//:
//: He was born with a condition called Achromatopsia, Peter didn't see colors, everything for him was seen in black and white. His biggest dream was to be able to see a rainbow.
//:
//: One day, Peter decided that he would try to reach the long-dreamed rainbow, so he embarked on a journey in search of the colors of the rainbow.
//: Peter knew it wouldn't be an easy journey, but he didn't give up.
//:
//: Click on “Run My Code” to see if Peter can find his way to the rainbow!
//: ## What are colors?
//: ![Grupo](grupo.png)
//:
//: Colors have different meanings that vary between different cultures. In some cultures, colors are related to human emotions.
//: Colors have been agreed to symbolize certain events or sensations.
//: ## How is the formation of a rainbow?
//: ![Arcoiris](arcoiris.png)
//: The rainbow is born from an encounter between sunlight and raindrops, which is why it only appears if there is rain falling and sun shining at the same time.
//:
//: The sunlight, which is white, is made of all colors. But for the colors to be separated, it is necessary that the light finds a drop of water. Rain clouds are made up of many drops of water. And this is how the rainbow is created!
//:
//: ## What is Achromatopsia?
//: Color blindness - also known as dyschromatopsia - is a type of blindness partially related to color.
//:
//: The main cause of color blindness is a genetic alteration that prevents the development of cells, of the eye, that allow us to observe colors, known as cones.
//:
//: When the cones are completely affected, achromatopsia is complete and, in these cases, you can only see it in black and white.
//:
//: ## About Me

//:
//: Currently, in a project I worked with colors and I could see how a color can influence someone's life. With this conclusion, I decided to create a simulation of a black and white world in a story to visually teach children the colors that make up the rainbow and the meaning of Achromatopsia.
